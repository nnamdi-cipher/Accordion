# Accordion

- This JavaScript mini project was done months ago, but I am just uploading it.
- After noticing that a lot of websites feature the accordion, I decided to learn how to build one.

- I used some resources online to learn how they made theirs and eventually made mine.

- Overall, I learnt how to use JavaScript to toggle the height of the container holding both the visible part of the accordion and the one we want hidden and then I worked with some little CSS animation. I also worked with the before and after CSS pseudo-classes.
