                              I frequent most of my social media handles when I am have the time but you
                              are most likely to reach me faster on Whatsapp, Instagram or via my email too.

                              Personally, I love to build projects from the ground up but several factors can alter that such as when 
                              the client wants the project to be completed within a very short period of time. I might in that case be forced
                              to make use of frameworks or libraries.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                              Honestly, it depends. Quite Often though, I receive 60% of the total amount agreed for the project and when it
                              is completed and the client is satisfied, I get my remaining 40% payment.
